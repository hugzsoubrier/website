Objectives
- to provide clear mapping of the main mosquito species sampled on 5 islands of Bijagos
Archipelago during the dry period (November/December) 2017.
- to collect, process and map remotely-sensed environmental and climatological data of interest
for the studied islands during the study period.
- to process and handle epidemiological data collected in 2017.
- to model the association between mosquito density, epidemiological and environmental
variables at each sampling sites.
- All analyses and data science were performed on R.

WORK EXPERIENCE
Bernhard Nocht Institute of Tropical Medicine Department of Virology (Nov 2020 -)
Research assistant on Lassa fever immunology in LAROCS project supervised by Dr. Elisabeth
Fichet-Calvet.
• Main project was investigating various human samples for IgG and IgM antibodies to assess the
potential for urine and saliva fluids in ELISA testing as correlates to classical blood samples.
• Work in CL-2 lab, with handling and inactivation of potentially infectious humans samples under
the hood using protective equipment.
• Designed and conduct ELISA test for IgG and IgM on +1,300 samples from Guinea and Sierra
Leone.
• Additional ELISA test salso performed on animals samples such as whole blood rodents and
ovins sera. In order to investigate the agreement between ELISA testing and gold-standard IFA
for animal serology.
• Viral RNA extraction, preparation of MasterMix and Real-Time Reverse-Transcriptase PCR for
Lassa Virus detection.
• Performed descriptive statistical analysis and mapping of study area for publications
Imperial College Department of Infectious Diseases Epidemiology (Aug-Sept 2018)
8 weeks UROP internship in Dr Nick Croucher’s Bacteriology group at St Mary’s Hospital (London).
• Research project focused on the S. pneumoniae competence system.
• Worked with pathogenic samples in a CL-2 lab
• Designed and conducted experiments on S. pneumoniae.
• Site-directed mutagenesis, gene cloning, PCR, preparation and plating of bacteria, colonies
counting, handling of protoplasts,
• Produced a detail protocol for the generation of S. pneumoniae protoplasts, and generation of
mutated endA gene, for study of competence asymmetry.
