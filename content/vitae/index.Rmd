Objectives:

- to provide clear mapping of the main mosquito species sampled on 5 islands of Bijagos Archipelago during the dry period (November/December) 2017.

- to collect, process and map remotely-sensed environmental and climatologic data of interest for the studied islands during the study period.

- to process and handle epidemiological data collected in 2017.

- to model the association between mosquito density, epidemiological and environmental variables at each sampling sites.

- All analyses, maps and data science were performed on R.
